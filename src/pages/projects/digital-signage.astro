                    <h2>Digital Signage CMS for American Airlines</h2>
                    <p class="case-summary">
                        As part of American Airlines’ new corporate campus
                        initiative, I developed a
                        <strong
                            >custom digital signage content management system</strong
                        > to power a network of over 100 screens and six large-format
                        LED displays across multiple buildings and global offices.
                        Off-the-shelf signage solutions couldn’t meet the need for
                        creative flexibility, real-time data integration, and centralized
                        control—so I built one from the ground up. Using a
                        <strong>heavily customized WordPress foundation</strong
                        >, the platform lets Corporate Communications schedule,
                        manage, and animate content seamlessly across
                        devices—from small embedded screens to massive LED
                        walls—supporting <strong
                            >HD video, live API data feeds, and continuous 24/7
                            playback</strong
                        > with strict brand consistency and performance optimization.

                    <h3>Requirements &amp; Challenges</h3>
                    <p>
                        When American Airlines opened its new corporate campus,
                        it created an opportunity to reimagine employee
                        engagement through real-time data, immersive multimedia,
                        and large-scale digital experiences. The buildings were
                        equipped with a network of information screens and
                        several large-format LED displays—high-impact visual
                        canvases designed to bring culture and communications to
                        life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Corporate Communications team needed a centralized
                        system to
                        <strong>control, curate, and schedule content</strong> across
                        this growing digital ecosystem. Existing signage products
                        offered useful features, but not the level of <strong
                            >customization, scalability, and creative
                            flexibility</strong
                        > required. A <strong>bespoke CMS</strong> was necessary—capable
                        of managing hundreds of displays, accommodating diverse hardware,
                        and delivering dynamic, brand-consistent content 24/7.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Six large-format LED displays—each roughly the size of a
                        shipping container
                        <!-- TODO: insert exact dimensions here, e.g., 9.6m × 2.7m -->
                        —were installed across the campus, including a centerpiece
                        at the main entrance. These displays welcome visitors and
                        keep employees informed with motion graphics, streaming video,
                        and real-time data visualizations. They needed to operate
                        continuously and transition smoothly between media types
                        while maintaining brand fidelity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond the headline displays, a network of <strong
                            >100+ smaller screens</strong
                        > was deployed throughout the campus <!-- TODO: insert exact sizes here -->,
                        with hundreds more in hubs and offices worldwide. These
                        localized screens deliver real-time updates, performance
                        metrics, and employee communications tailored to each
                        location. Hardware diversity was a major challenge: LED
                        walls ran on high-performance PCs, while smaller
                        displays relied on lightweight embedded
                        devices—demanding a <strong
                            >dual-architecture approach</strong
                        > to preserve visual quality and interactivity across environments.
